# set-up-a-ci-cd-pipeline-on-aws

## Overview


In this project, I learned how to configure an AWS CI/CD pipeline. A pipeline allows you to automate processes in your software delivery process, such as starting automated builds and deploying to Amazon EC2 instances. I utilized AWS CodePipeline, a service that creates, tests, and delivers your code depending on the release process models I created. To choreograph each stage of your release process, use CodePipeline. I'll connect other AWS services to CodePipeline as part of your setup to complete my software delivery pipeline.
